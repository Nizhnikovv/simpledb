# SimpleDB - A Simple Relational DBMS

SimpleDB is a simple relational database management system, originaly implemented by professor Edward Sciore in his book [Database Design and Implementation](https://www.amazon.com/Database-Design-Implementation-Data-Centric-Applications/dp/3030338355?crid=2RA77Y7EV2K0Y&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.7tga9E_bl8msW5-z9Pn4KskH4o0WO2KkFYRElD9-pgM-6gTCxgVaSmvrzN5Gof-0g7dm3DTEw16-XNSN_sn6g8ZUbSQTmS7cIUf_wGekniuqSGczjjmBun7eFozLgslkoZDWnT3tw6XlXKQJrZP84VtdpoHEtdvPrf5NvXmB_PYRT2h41J-3jwiHwPUDljCVeZRzEZd2H7TKPSAeqfbZo_UnX7SJ2qby932MY9zW0Mk.yCb5x2f5hZsfvxZvRy1aCu6CmIqD8T_0weNQSPVx7Tc&dib_tag=se&keywords=Database+Design+and+Implementation&qid=1732711934&s=books&sprefix=database+design+and+implementation,stripbooks-intl-ship,472&sr=1-1).

The idea is to implement SimpleDB in Go (mostly) following the mentioned book as a main material and cover evertyghing in a series of Youtube videos for everyone to follow along.
